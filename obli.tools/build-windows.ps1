# build-windows.ps1 - Build ObliTools.exe and ObliToolsSetup.msi for Windows
# Run from the obli.tools/ directory:
#   .\build-windows.ps1
#
# Prerequisites:
#   - Go 1.21+ (with CGO_ENABLED=1 and MinGW/MSVC in PATH)
#   - WiX Toolset v4: dotnet tool install --global wix
#
# To release a new version:
#   1. Edit obli.tools/VERSION  (e.g. 1.2.0)
#   2. Run this script - the version is injected everywhere automatically.
#
# Outputs:
#   dist\ObliTools.exe        - portable executable
#   dist\ObliToolsSetup.msi   - Windows installer with Start Menu + optional Desktop shortcut

# NOTE: Set-StrictMode is intentionally NOT used here.
# On certain PowerShell + Go version combinations, Set-StrictMode -Version Latest causes
# variables set before a `go run` call to become undefined afterwards (a known PS strict-mode
# interaction with native commands).  $ErrorActionPreference = 'Stop' is sufficient.
$ErrorActionPreference = 'Stop'
